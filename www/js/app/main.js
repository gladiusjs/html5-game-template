// This file hosts the main game module.  Whenever it makes sense to
// put something in its own module, you can either put it in the dependency
// array for this module (i.e. the way we're using 'game-shim' in th commented
// out version below), or you can call require() directly closer to the
// time you need it.  <http://requirejs.org/> has detailed documentation.  
//

define(function(require) {

  // Toji's game-shim module is included with this template; if you wish to use
  // it, uncomment the require() line below.
  //
  // The reason that this isn't done by default is that the replacement
  // versions of the various APIs that it includes could potentially cause
  // complications or performance issues with other libraries that use these APIs
  // and may have their own strategies for dealing with cross-browser issues.  
  // We suggest reviewing the code (in lib/game-shim.js) before enabling it.
  //
  //require('game-shim');
