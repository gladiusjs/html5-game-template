// This file hosts the main game module.  Whenever it makes sense to
// put something in its own module, you can either put it in the dependency
// array for this module (i.e. the way we're using 'game-shim' in th commented
// out version below), or you can call require() directly closer to the
// time you need it.  <http://requirejs.org/> has detailed documentation.  
//
//
// Toji's game-shim module is included with this template; if you wish to use
// it, replace the define() below this comment with this one:
//
// define(['game-shim'], function (gameshim) {
//
// The reason that this isn't done by default is that the replacement
// versions of the various APIs that it includes could potentially cause
// complications or performance issues with other libraries that use these APIs
// and may have their own strategies for dealing with cross-browser issues.  
// We suggest reviewing the code (in lib/game-shim.js) before enabling it.
//
define(function(require) {
  
});
